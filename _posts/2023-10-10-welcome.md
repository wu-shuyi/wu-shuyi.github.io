Hello, this is Shuyi, she/her. 吴淑仪 <br>

My background is in psychology and cognitive neuroscience. <br>
<br>
I have some research experience in understanding both psychological and neural mechanisms of social cognition, decision-making, and memory cognition, such as retrospective memory, and also health ageing. <br>
<br>
During my previous studies and training, I picked up some brain-imaging analysis skills, including EEG and fMRI.  <br>
I did my first fMRI study to understand the neural activities underlying the decoy effect when I was a master's student. In this project, I gained some basic fMRI analysis, including preprocessing/contrast analysis (GLM) and functional connectivity analysis (PPI and DCM). <br> 
Later, I finished two coordinate-based fMRI meta-analysis projects using ALE and other meta-analytic functional connectivity, including MACM and RSFC. <br>
<br>
When I was a visiting student in Cambridge, I also worked on a project about understanding the relationship between neurovascular health and behavioural performance. In most previous research, they would focus on the confounding effects caused by the decline in neurovascular activities especially in ageing research. However, our research goal is not just to dissociate the confounding effects but also to see how neurovascular activities influence cognitive behaviours. <br>
<br>
My long-term goal is to get a Ph.D. degree in a neuroscience-related field and become a researcher in the future. <br>
<br>
<br>
I'm applying for the PhD this cycle! <br>
